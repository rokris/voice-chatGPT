# Speech Recognition Chatbot

This is a chatbot that uses speech recognition and OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate responses.

## How it works

1. The chatbot prompts the user for input.
2. It generates a response using the user's input and conversation history.
3. The chatbot prints and speaks the response.

With this chatbot, you can have a conversation with it just like you would with a human!  Give it a try and see what it can do.

Remember to create a file with name api_secret.py and add the API_KEY from openai.com in there.
